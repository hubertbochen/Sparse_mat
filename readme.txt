# Sparse Test Project

This project is designed to test and demonstrate the implementation of sparse matrix operations in the C programming language.

## Features

- Efficient representation of sparse matrices.
- Basic operations such as addition, multiplication, and transposition.
- File-based input and output for matrix data.

## Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).

## How to Build

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using the following command:
    ```
    gcc -o sparse_test main.c sparse_matrix.c
    ```

## How to Run

1. Ensure that the compiled executable `sparse_test` is in the current directory.
2. Run the program using the following command:
    ```
    ./sparse_test
    ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input matrix data or load it from a file.
