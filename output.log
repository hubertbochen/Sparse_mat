2D Poisson solver on L-shaped domain using FIM and sparse matrix
C++17, OpenMP 16 threads
Assemble laplacian matrix and solve using Gauss-Seidel iteration
Exact solution: u = exp(x*y-x) + y, Laplacian = (x^2 + (y-1)^2)*exp(x*y-x)
Domain: L-shape with vertices (0,-2),(0,2),(2,2),(2,1),(1,1),(1,-2)
Mesh: uniform grid with nx by ny points, spacing hx, hy
Boundary condition: Dirichlet u=0 on outer boundary
Inner boundary (the cut-out triangle): u = exact solution
------------------------------------------------------------
Mesh size: nx = 129, ny = 257
Domain: x in [0.00, 2.00], y in [-2.00, 2.00]
Laplacian matrix built with 111781 elements
Solving with Gauss-Seidel: n=22817, max_iter=100000, tol=1e-10
Gauss-Seidel converged in 31194 iterations
Gauss-Seidel finished, residual norm = 8.188605e-07
Calculation time: 15.410000 seconds
Error: max = 2.641860e-05, L2 = 8.987796e-06
